The repository contains data, catalogues, results and plots for the ATCA 5.5 GHz observations of the candidate protoclusters G018 and G345. Data from G345 was not studied further due to sidelobe contamination of a bright radio source in the centre of the map. The directories represent:

[completeness] Completeness tests of source catalogues in G018

[G018_aplpy_results] Maps of G018 produced using Python package Aplpy

[G018_diff_number_counts] Differential number counts of G018 sources compared with the field survey

[source_detect_g018_5500, source_detect_g018_9000] Source detection and flux extraction for G018 at 5.5 GHz (5500 MHz) and at 9 GHz (9000 MHz) using Blobcat and Miriad's "sfind" task.


All the data, plots and results are the works of the author. Please email the author if you want to use/reproduce any data or plots: taianmoon@gmail.com
