Beginning FDR analysis...
*************************

FDR selected a p-value threshold of     0.0000004019.
This corresponds to a threshold of    4.94 sigma,
which means a minimum flux threshold of     0.0000328939 Jy.
(If the noise is constant over the original image,
this is the threshold over the whole image.)
FDR detected     544 pixels.
